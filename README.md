# EDGAR
Emotion Detection, Gathering, Analysis and Response (EDGAR) is a project which aims to detect emotion from voice data in real time.

# RECORDING AUDIO
Recorded audio will be processed in the live_audio file, and will not be stored. Only the metrics from the recording will be saved.

# TO THE DEVELOPERS
Please be sure to thoroughly comment your code so that each team members can easily pick up your work
where you left off. This will also make it more usable if it gets used by a grad student who may continue our work.
