Licensing information for SpeechRecognition can be found within the SpeechRecognition README. https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/README.rst#license

SpeechRecognition distributes binaries from FLAC - speech_recognition/flac-win32.exe, speech_recognition/flac-linux-x86, and speech_recognition/flac-mac. These files are GPLv2-licensed and redistributable, as long as the terms of the GPL are satisfied. The FLAC binaries are an aggregate of separate programs, so these GPL restrictions do not apply to the library or your programs that use the library, only to FLAC itself.
